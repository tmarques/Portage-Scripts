Scripts written in BASH to help with a Gentoo Portage Tree Fork. 
They make it easier to merge specific upstream ebuilds into my local tree.

mk* scripts create SquashFS'ed versions of the tree, which serve two purposes:
- Fit a full tree in embedded systems
- Search the tree faster in desktop systems, since the SQFSed tree is less than 100MB compared to 700+ which must be loaded from spinning media.
